We have created a [Slack](http://slack.com/) server for BIOMOD. Everyone is welcome to join, introduce themselves, ask questions, etc. Check it out by clicking the button below, and requesting an invite:

<script async defer src="http://slack.biomod.net/slackin.js?large"></script>

Once you sign up, you can read this [Getting Started Guide](https://biomod.slack.com/getting-started/users).

Slack can be used in the [browser](http://biomod.slack.com/), or you can download the [desktop and mobile clients](https://slack.com/apps).
