Our friends in the [Molecular Robotics Group](http://www.molbot.org/) in Japan have been organizing a regional, online-only BIOMOD competition in recent years, the [BIOMOD Japan Open](https://biomod.jp/en/). The competition takes place in English.

In past years, BIOMOD Japan participants worked remotely and designed purely computational experiments. This year, BIOMOD Japan Open will resume performing in-person wet-lab experiments.

Note that BIOMOD Japan Open teams are recommended to build their project around a shared theme. This year, the project theme is: *molecular robots that can contribute to the low-carbon economy*.

Free registration is now open, and the planned Jamboree date is **Saturday, September 17th, 2022**.

Please [visit the website](https://biomod.jp/en/) and [contact the organizers](https://biomod.jp/en/#contact) if you have any questions.
