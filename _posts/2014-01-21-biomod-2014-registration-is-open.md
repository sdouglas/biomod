Hello BIOMODders! 

Ready to sign up? Visit our [online form](https://biomod.wufoo.com/forms/2014-registration-form/) to register between now and April 30th, 2014. Please make sure you have read our [how to join](/pages/how-to-join) and [requirements](/pages/requirements) pages.<!--more-->

This year we are implementing a nominal fee ($250) for registration. In recent years, the event, including free lodging for students, has cost roughly $4000 per team. In order to make BIOMOD sustainable, we must begin to recover some of the costs from each team. Moreover, some teams have previously signed up but failed to attend, creating additional administrative burden for us. We hope that that a small fee will also mean fewer cancellations, and more time for us to spend making BIOMOD a success!
