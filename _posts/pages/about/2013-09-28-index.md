BIOMOD is a <strong>bio</strong>-<strong>mo</strong>lecular <strong>d</strong>esign competition that provides undergraduates an opportunity to systematically engineer the self-assembly of biological macromolecules into complex nanoscale machines for scientific and technological purposes.

Students form teams in the early spring, and then spend the summer to design, build, and analyze their systems. All teams converge at the <a href="http://wyss.harvard.edu/">Wyss Institute for Biologically Inspired Engineering</a> at Harvard in the fall to present their work at the <a href="/jamboree">Jamboree</a>.
