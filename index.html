BIOMOD is a design competition in which undergraduate teams compete to master control of biomolecules on the nanometer scale. Focus areas may include — but are not limited to — biomolecular robotics, biomolecular logic and computing, and structural bionanotechnology. Students conceive and execute projects during the summer and then gather in Boston in November to present their work and win awards.
