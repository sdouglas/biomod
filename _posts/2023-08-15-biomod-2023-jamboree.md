Jamboree registration and project abstract submission for BIOMOD 2023 starts Aug. 15! We reduced this year's jamboree attendance fee:
- Offline: 5,000 JPY (approx. 35 USD) per attendee
- Online: Free

We hope this pricing will encourage many participants to join the jamboree offline in Tokyo this year.
Please follow the link below for the registration. Note that registrations are only considered complete when payment is received, and a confirmation email is sent.
