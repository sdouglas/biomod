Hello BIOMODders! It's time to kick off the 7th year of our nano-sized design competition.

**Requirements updates**

- Maximum team size is still **8 students**. Faculty, graduate, and postdoc mentors do not count toward this tally.
- We will begin enforcing the **3-minute maximum length** for Project YouTube videos.
- Intellectual Property: Teams must disclose technical details of their projects to be eligible for judging. Provisional patents, if necessary, should be filed *in advance* of the judging period.
- We have added an Code of Conduct. To our knowledge, past participants have adhered to this code, but we would like to make it explicit so expectations are clear.

**Judging updates**

We have simplified our ranking procedure for Gold, Silver, and Bronze project awards. Bronze awards go to teams that satisfy all project requirements. Silver awards go to teams with scores in the top 50%, and Gold awards go to teams with scores in the top 25%.

**Registration & Fees**

Watch the timer on the BIOMOD front page...this registration link will go live at the end of the countdown. A fee of $265 USD is due at the time of team registration, payable by credit card or wire transfer. This year's individual Jamboree registration fee will be $195 USD per person, due in late September along with your project title and abstract. Registrations are only considered complete when payment is received and a confirmation email is sent.

**Available Team Slots and Wait List**

The BIOMOD Jamboree is a special event, and we want all participants to be able to present in the same room, and have a chance to interact. This format places constraints on our event size and duration. Therefore, we are limiting registration to a maximum of 25 teams this year. We will post regular updates on the BIOMOD website and social media accounts so everyone can track how many slots are left.

**Venue**

The Jamboree will take place October 27â€“28 in San Francisco, California and be hosted at the UCSF Mission Bay campus.
