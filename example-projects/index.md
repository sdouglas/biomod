Past project wikis and websites can be found [here](http://openwetware.org/wiki/Biomod).

We encourage students to take the extra step to carry out background research to learn about the state of the art in the area of biomolecular nanotechnology. Wikipedia is an excellent place to start, including pages about [DNA nanotechnology](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA_nanotechnology), [Nucleic acid design](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nucleic_acid_design), and [DNA computing](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA_computing).

The Dietz lab at TU Munich also hosts a nice overview of [Biomolecular nanotechnology](http://bionano.physik.tu-muenchen.de/biomolecular_nanotechnology.html), and another specifically about [DNA nanotechnology](http://bionano.physik.tu-muenchen.de/DNA_nanotechnology.html).

For more up-to-date news, subscribe to our [Twitter](https://twitter.com/biomod) feed, where we constantly post links to novel and relevant research articles in the field.
