Dear BIOMOD community: we have received an overwhelming response this year, and just reached the physical space limit in the auditorium over 2 weeks before our registration deadline.

<!--more-->

We understand that many teams have been planning to register between now and the April 30th deadline. Unfortunately we cannot promise a spot at this time, but now must direct all unregistered teams to the <a target="_blank" href="https://biomod.wufoo.com/forms/2015-registration-waitlist/">wait list form</a>. We will work to confirm payments and team sizes of those that already requested to register, and then try to open up additional spots. If we can open up additional spots, we will require payment only by credit card.

Please keep in mind that somtimes the growth of a community temporarily outpaces the logistical resources of early organizers. For example, this year the <a target="_blank" href="http://bit.ly/1CRiEK6">Cryo-EM Gordon Research Conference</a> faced the largest oversubscription in its history, with nearly 300 attempting to register for 178 spots over 3 months before its deadline. 

Thanks for your understanding and patience while we try to sort through possible options. If you have any concerns, questions, suggestions, or offers to help out, please email me at shawn.douglas@ucsf.edu.
