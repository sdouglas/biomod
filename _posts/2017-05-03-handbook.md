We are publishing a BIOMOD Handbook this year!

It is an English translation of the Japanese BIOMOD textbook, generously contributed by the authors of the Molecular Robotics Study Group (Murata, Tadakuma, Fujiwara, Hamada, Nomura, et al.). Sales proceeds will go to BIOMOD Foundation to cover translation costs.

Chapter 1 is now available, additional chapters will be released in the coming weeks. All BIOMOD students will receive a free copy with registration. Everyone else can get the book via this link:
