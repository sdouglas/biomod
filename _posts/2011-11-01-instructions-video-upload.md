Once you have uploaded your YouTube video, please embed (<a href="http://bit.ly/scUA1B">instructions</a>) it on the front page of your team wiki (or link to it <em>prominently</em> if necessary).

Judges will be provided with your team wiki url, and they will expect to find the YouTube video in the same place.
