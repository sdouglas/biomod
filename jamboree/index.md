## What is it?

The BIOMOD Jamboree is an annual conference at which all BIOMOD teams will convene to present their work from the summer. This year's Jamboree is scheduled to take place in Genentech Hall at UCSF in San Francisco, CA starting on {{ site.jamboree_start_time | date: '%B %-d, %Y' }}.

## Judging and Awards

Teams will be judged according to [criteria posted here](/judging).

## Hotel

The official hotel of BIOMOD 2018 is the Marriott Marquis located at 780 Mission Street (at 4th Street) in downtown San Francisco.  We were able to secure a group rate of $189 US per night.  Reservations can be made here [Marriott Marquis Room Reservations]. (http://www.marriott.com/meeting-event-hotels/group-corporate-travel/groupCorp.mi?resLinkData=BIOMOD%202018%20Room%20Block%5ESFODT%60BIOBIOA%60189.00%60USD%60false%604%6010/26/18%6010/31/18%6010/5/18&app=resvlink&stop_mobi=yes)

Unfortunately, due to a city-wide event the week prior to the Jamboree, the Marriott Marquis is not able to accommodate early arrivals.  Rooms will not be available before October 26. There are, however, a limited number of rooms available for late check-out.  If you would like to stay beyond October 28, it is advised to make your bookings immediately.  

Our room block closes on October 5.  All room reservations must be made by this date in order to secure the group rate of $189 US.
