This page outlines the requirements for team structure and project deliverables.

## Registration fees

- **Team:** Team registration is ${{ site.team_registration_fee }}. This is due before April 30th in order to reserve a team presentation slot at the Jamboree.
- **Individual:** The *nonrefundable* Jamboree registration fee is ${{ site.individual_registration_fee }} *per person* (not including hotel lodging), due September 25th.
- **Where does my fee go?** Registration fees cover program expenses including renting the venue, A/V, catering, photographer, t-shirts, award certificates, transportation, and website development.

## Team structure

- **Mentoring:** Each team must have at least one faculty advisor. We also recommend having at least one graduate student or postdoc mentor available to work closely with students during the summer.
- **Size:** Teams should have a maximum of **8 students** per team. We request that you only register one team per institution.
- **Scope:** Project planning is entirely up to the team. Given time constraints for presenting the work, we recommend that each team focus on a single project.
- **Composition:** Teams should consist primarily of undergraduate students (studying towards a bachelor's degree, or graduating this year) at an accredited college or university. High school students are welcome. Graduate students and postdocs should serve as mentors.


## Project Timeline

This is a rough suggestion for how a BIOMOD team might organize their project. Please also note the important deadlines on [this page](/how-join).

- **January–March:** Team organizers should recruit team members: post flyers and email announcements, interview interested students, and send notifications early while everyone is still finalizing their summer plans.
- **April–May:** Register your team. Students should begin independent background reading to start learning about topics that may interest them. Organize brainstorming meetings to determine project topic.
- **June–August:** Do the project! Also, start planning the YouTube video as early as possible. Book travel arrangements and apply for Visas if necessary
- **September–October:** Complete project wiki, video, and presentation. Register for Jamboree.
