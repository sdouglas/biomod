**The Back story**

I met Jason Brown 27 years ago in first grade, so we've been doing fun projects for a while.
So... It's been 4 years since my friend Jason Brown and I created a whiteboard animation called "What is Bionanotechnology?"

Anyway, last winter we thought it would be cool to make a new animation to help explain the concept behind the BIOMOD competition. Just like all our previous projects, it took about 3 times longer than expected, but I'm happy to report that it's finished!

**The Making Of...**

The best part of any project is usually the start. We just hang out, joke around, and draw silly sketches and reflect on the fact that the Simpsons writers really have done *everything* already.

**Building the Team**

Our projects have gotten too ambitious for only one or two people to do in their mythological "spare" time. So the first step was convincing folks at the Wyss Institute to give us a budget so Jason could be paid for the work (he now does freelance animation professionally through his company PSM). We also contracted with Leslie & Kevin from C3 Science on initial drafts of the script. Finally, our multi-talented friend Joel Wasko chipped in for the sound design and editing, even coached via telephone our voice talent Dani, whom we found at voices.com.

**The Tools**

Whiteboard animations are everywhere now, so we wanted to upgrade into full-fledged animation. There are some things we'll probably always use, like the Wacom Cintiq. Or Adobe After Effects (at least as long as we can avoid "Creative Cloud"). For this project we added Animate Pro from ToonBoom.

**The Slog**

Jason really did all the heavy lifting on this project... he is well into triple digit hours, and I'll probably be paying him for overtime well into retirement age. It turns out that puppeteering in Animate Pro doesn't really work like you'd hope, and traditional frame-by-frame animation is way more fluid. And the inking process (re-tracing with color) can take even longer than the initial animation! It also takes a while to learn to hit the right keyframes and use the right gestures, and generally animate in an economical fashion.


**The Final Product**

Making it was the fun part, as usual, but we hope a few people enjoy it as well. Perhaps current and future BIOMOD students will find it useful to share with friends and family in response to the inevitable question "So.... what are you doing this summer? Relaxing on the beach?" :)

cheers,
