Our friends in the [Molecular Robotics Group](http://www.molbot.org/) in Japan have been organizing a regional, online-only BIOMOD competition in recent years, the [BIOMOD Japan Open](https://biomod.jp/en/). The competition takes place in English.

In past years, all participants worked remotely, designing purely computational experiments. This year, teams participating in the BIOMOD Japan Open will resume performing in-person wet-lab experiments.

Note that teams that participate in the BIOMOD Japan Open have developed projects based on a common theme. This year's theme is: "molecular robots that can contribute to the low-carbon economy."

Registration is now open, and the planned Jamboree date is Saturday, September 17th, 2022.
