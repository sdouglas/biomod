Dear Colleagues,

As you may have noticed in our previous announcement, BIOMOD, International Biomolecular Design Competition, is back this year and resuming its annual jamboree event in November. This year, 16 teams from 8 countries have registered for the competition, and currently, we estimate 14 will present at the jamboree, either online or on-site.
To further regain the momentum and make the event a continuous educational activity for the next generation of researchers in our community, BIOMOD needs your help! Specifically, we would like to ask for your help with two topics:

## Call for Judges
We need your help participating in this year’s competition as a judge. The online judging period (webpage and YouTube video) will take place on Oct 28 – Nov 3 (JST), and the live presentation judging at the jamboree will be held as a hybrid style (on-site and Zoom) on Nov 4 (JST). Joining the judging online, even part of the process, is also welcomed.

## Future Plans
We are planning to make BIOMOD into a more international and open organization to make it more sustainable for the foreseeable future. As we mark the tenth event and restart after COVID, this timing would be a perfect opportunity to think about the next chapter of BIOMOD. We would like to have your input and form our future with volunteer mentors and judges. Please join the discussion if you are interested. Based on our online discussion, we are planning to hold an on-site meeting after the jamboree on 11/5 at Tokyo Tech.

# Registration Form
For registration, please fill out the [form (deadline Oct. 14)](https://forms.gle/ED2YgEVuZDcJSCPe7)
 (Google Form).
Your comments and participation are highly appreciated.
Thank you in advance for your time and cooperation.
