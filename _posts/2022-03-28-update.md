Dear BIOMOD Community,

We have been closely monitoring international, national, and local policies that are relevant to hosting in-person events like BIOMOD. Unfortunately, we have determined that it is not yet possible for our small team to organize a large in-person event at UCSF. In particular, the potential emergence of new Sars-CoV-2 variants remains a signficant risk for canceling our event.

For those of you who are eager to participate in a student design competition, you may consider [iGEM](https://competition.igem.org/), which is planning to host in-person Jamboree October 20â€“23 in Paris, France.

In the meantime, we are evaluating possible alternative structures and activities for BIOMOD that will enable us to resume our mission of promoting science and science education around the world.

Sincerely,<br>
Shawn Douglas Ph.D.<br>
Chairman, BIOMOD Foundation<br>
