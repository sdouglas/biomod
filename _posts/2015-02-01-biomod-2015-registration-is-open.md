Hello BIOMODders! 

Ready to sign up? Visit our <a target="_blank" href="https://biomod.wufoo.com/forms/2015-registration-form/">registration form</a> to register between now and April 30th, 2015. Please make sure you have read our [how to join](/how-join) and [requirements](/requirements) pages.

This year we are continuing our policy of collecting a **TEAM** registration fee ($250 USD)

In addition, when it comes time to register for the Jamboree, we will be collecting an **INDIVIDUAL** registration fee ($ amount TBA). We are in the process of negotiating the best possible rates for all of the expenses to run BIOMOD (venue, A/V, catering, etc), and attempting to raise [sponsorship](/sponsors/) funds. The per-person individual fee will be set **as low as possible** to break even on the event - rest assured that we are not making any money, just covering expenses. Please plan for roughly $200 per person, plus lodging expenses.
