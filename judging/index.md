### Overview

Our aim is to maintain an open and fair process for evaluating each team's performance. Teams will be scored by judges using a point system. The judging process will have two stages: online content (worth up to **75 points**) and live presentation (worth up to **25 points**).

### Judge selection

- Judges will be selected from a pool of BIOMOD faculty mentors and outside experts.
- Mentors will not evaluate their own team.
- Judges' names will be disclosed in the QuickGuide.

### Online content scoring

- Maximum combined score for online content is **75 points** (= 50 points for wiki + 25 points for internet video)
- Scores will be determined by a [range-voting system](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Range_voting)
- Five (5) judges will be randomly assigned to each team
- Judges will evaluate each project according to a rubric (see below) and assign a point value in each category.
- Highest and lowest judges' total scores are excluded to remove outliers.
- Three remaining judges' scores will each weighted by 1/3 and combined to determine the total scores for each category.

### Live presentation scoring

- All judges present at the Jamboree will be asked to rate all presentations.
- Highest and lowest judges' total scores are excluded to remove outliers.
- The remaining n judges' scores will be weighted by 1/n and combined to determine the total scores for the presentation.


## Requirement compliance

- Teams are responsible for satisfying all project criteria described on this page and the [requirements](/requirements/) page, including maximum team size (8 undergraduate students, plus mentors).
- Judges have discretion to award points for meeting requirements for video and presentation length.
- We reserve the right to disqualify teams from receiving awards if they fail to adhere to BIOMOD requirements. Final decisions are at the discretion of the BIOMOD Foundation Board of Directors.
