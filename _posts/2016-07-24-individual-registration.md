Greetings BIOMODders! Hopefully your projects are taking shape and will continue to build momentum in the next 3 months before we meet in San Francisco! Some brief announcements:

## Individual Registration, Visa Letters, Hotels

- All primary contacts have been sent invitation emails to register an individual account on the BIOMOD 2016 website.
- Primary contacts should now invite all other team members using the "invite team members" link from their profile page:

- Once registered, you can view your profile and team page, generate a visa invitation letter if needed, register for the Jamboree (deadline September 25), and find the link to book your hotel room using the BIOMOD group rate.


## Team Websites

- Team websites have been created on GitLab, and information for gaining admin access to edit them has been sent to primary contacts.
- Once you have claimed your team website and linked it with a GitLab account, the owner of that account can add more team members directly from the project page by clicking the settings "gear" button in the top-right corner and visiting the "Members" link.

## Additional notes

- If you are primary contact of your team and did not receive any of the above information, please [contact us](/contact) immediately.
- If you are **NOT** primary contact on your team, and you have not yet heard anything about registering an individual account, or the setting up your team website, please check with your primary contact.
- Students may serve as primary contacts (in fact, it is often more efficient). If you wish to change the primary contact for the team, that is fine â€” just let us know via the [contact form](/contact).
