Hello BIOMODders! It's time to kick off the 9th (!) year of our nano-sized design competition.

**Registration & Fees**

Watch the timer on the BIOMOD front page...this registration link will go live at the end of the countdown. We had to push back our registration by one day this year to finish making a few updates to our registration portal system.

A fee of $275 USD is due at the time of team registration, payable by credit card or wire transfer. This year's individual Jamboree registration fee will be $200 USD per person, due in late September along with your project title and abstract. Registrations are only considered complete when payment is received and a confirmation email is sent.


**Available Team Slots and Wait List**

The BIOMOD Jamboree is a special event, and we want all participants to be able to present in the same room, and have a chance to interact. This intimate format necessarily constrains our event size and duration. Therefore, we are limiting registration to a maximum of 25 teams this year. We will post regular updates on the BIOMOD website and social media accounts so everyone can track how many slots are left. If we reach the maximum number of teams before March 31st, we will close registration early, and open a wait list. Teams on the wait list may have the option to register early for BIOMOD 2020.

**Venue**

The Jamboree will take place October 25â€“27 in San Francisco, California and be hosted at the UCSF Mission Bay campus. We can offer discounted hotel rates to registered teams...more details to come.
