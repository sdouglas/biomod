We (Kris, Byron, and Shawn) launched a new (and hopefully improved) BIOMOD website! It now includes photos from the first three years of the competition, as well as a handy countdown timer to see how long is left until the next deadline or event. The design itself is responsive, so it should be more mobile-device friendly.
