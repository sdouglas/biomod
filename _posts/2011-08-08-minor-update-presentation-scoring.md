Based on some feedback we received from BIOMOD participants, we have updated the point assignments for the Presentation section on the <a href="/judging">judging page</a>. 

Rather than assigning fixed point values to 1st through 6th place teams, we will use a proportional scoring system. The team that receives the most votes will receive 25 points. And all other teams will receive points in proportion to the number of votes they received relative to the first place team. This ensures that teams that tie will receive equal points, and every team that receives votes will be awarded points.
