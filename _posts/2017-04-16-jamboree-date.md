For the past 5 months, we have been planning for BIOMOD 2017 to take place on October 28–29. However, that date may no longer work because a UCSF campus-wide event was just announced that takes priority over all existing auditorium bookings.

After exploring many alternatives, we have concluded that the best option is to reschedule the event for the following weekend: November 4–5th, 2017. Please see the [Jamboree page](/jamboree) for the latest information about this year's deadlines and schedule

We sincerely apologize for the inconvenience and hope this change will not cause any problems for your team. However, if you wish to cancel your registration for a full refund, please let Shawn or Rebecca know by April 30th.

We also appreciate feedback about the dates — if this weekend turns out to work better than the prior weekend, we can keep a similar schedule next year.
