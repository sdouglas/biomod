All current information is available in the [BIOMOD Handbook](https://leanpub.com/biomod/c/igEXW9UZfX8p), which is free for all BIOMOD participants. The website instructions can be found in Chapter 1, and are reproduced below.

*Once your site is set up, please remember to enter the URL on your team profile page on the BIOMOD 2017 portal site so judges can find it.*

**How to Create A Website**

There are many options to set up a website, including Weebly, Wordpress, GitHub Pages or GitLab Pages.

[Weebly](https://www.weebly.com/), and [Wordpress](https://wordpress.org/) are both great options for building your team website, especially if your team does not have experience with web design. Advanced users will prefer more customizable alternatives below.

[GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) was introduced as a website option for BIOMOD in 2014. It is free, and supports the [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) static-site generator, or hard-coded HTML sites. Users who have experience with [git](https://git-scm.com/) source code management may prefer this option. We find that [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/) can be useful for managing file synchronization.

[GitLab Pages](https://pages.gitlab.io/) is a similar alternative to GitHub Pages. It allows the greatest flexibility in that any major static-site generator can be used, such as Hugo, Pelican, or Jekyll. GitLab also offers free private git repositories.

On a historical note, early BIOMOD teams used [OpenWetWare](http://www.openwetware.org/wiki/Biomod), which runs on the same software that powers Wikipedia. This is why you may see references to the team "Wiki" â€” that just refers to the team website. OpenWetWare is a fantastic community resource and houses lots of synthetic biology knowledge from its use by iGEM teams and research groups for open lab notebooks. However, it is showing its age from a web-design perspective, and most teams prefer more modern alternatives.
