Dear BIOMOD Community,

We are pleased to announce that BIOMOD will officially resume this year as a "hybrid" event, with options for in-person and online participation.

This year's competition is being organized by the [Molecular Robotics Research Group](http://www.molbot.org/) of Japan (MOLBOT), with support from the BIOMOD Foundation. MOLBOT has organized many successful regional [BIOMOD.jp](https://biomod.jp/en/index.html) events, including online-only events during the past few years.

The jamboree will take place <em>November 4th and 5th</em> at Tokyo Tech in Tokyo, Japan.

We will share more details soon. Please contact us if you have any questions.

Sincerely,<br>
Shawn Douglas Ph.D.<br>
Chairman, BIOMOD Foundation<br>
