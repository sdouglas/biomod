Dear BIOMOD Community,

As you know, the BIOMOD 2021 competition was canceled due to COVID-19.

Some of you have begun to inquire about registering for BIOMOD 2022. Although we are looking forward to resuming the competition as soon as it is safe and logistically feasible, unfortunately we are not yet able to do so at this time.

We typically need to make reservations for event space and lodging a full year in advance of hosting the Jamboree. Due to continued uncertainty caused by the pandemic, it is not currently possible to make those necessary commitments.

Based on the current vaccination efforts that are underway in San Francisco and worldwide, it seems that the earliest that we *might* be able host the next competition is March 2023. If that is the case, then we will announce open registration in March 2022.

I hope to have a more positive update around this time next year. In the meantime, take care everyone.

Sincerely,<br>
Shawn Douglas Ph.D.<br>
Chairman, BIOMOD Foundation<br>
