Hello BIOMODders! It's time to kick off the 6th year of our nano-sized design competition.

**Registration & Fees**

Watch the timer on the BIOMOD front page...this registration link will go live at the end of the countdown. A fee of $250 USD is due at the time of team registration, payable by credit card or wire transfer. This year's individual Jamboree registration fee will be $180 USD per person, due in late September along with your project title and abstract. Registrations are only considered complete when payment is received and a confirmation email is sent.


**Available Team Slots and Wait List**

The BIOMOD Jamboree is a special event, and we want all participants to be able to present in the same room, and have a chance to interact (more interaction time is our #1 feedback request). This intimate format necessarily constrains our event size and duration. Therefore, we are limiting registration to a maximum of 30 teams this year. We will post regular updates on the BIOMOD website and social media accounts so everyone can track how many slots are left. If we reach the maximum number of teams before April 30th, we will close registration early, and open a wait list. Teams on the wait list may have the option to register early for BIOMOD 2017.

**Venue**

The Jamboree will take place October 28â€“30 in San Francisco, California and be hosted at the UCSF Mission Bay campus. We can offer discounted hotel rates to registered teams...more details to come.

**New Category Award: Best Use of Game Engine**

This year we will be exploring project & presentation formats that begin to anticipate next-generation computing hardware (e.g. virtual and/or augmented reality headsets). Practically speaking, this means that we will introduce a category award to encourage teams to utilize a 3D game engine, such as [Unity](https://unity3d.com/) or [Unreal](https://www.unrealengine.com/) in their projects, however they wish. Last year's Grand Prize winning [Team Sendai](http://teamsendai.github.io/Simulation.html) already did this for simulation purposes, but we think this innovative use case only scratches the surface of what is possible.
