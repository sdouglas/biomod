In order to accommodate all of the presentations this year, teams should prepare a **10-minute talk**. The [Requirements](/requirements) page has been updated to reflect this change. Previously the presentation time allotment was 12 minutes.

Note that the TOTAL time alloted to each team is is 15 minutes. This includes laptop setup (1 min), present slides (10 min), audience questions (~3 min), and exiting the stage (1 min).
