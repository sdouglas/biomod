We encourage everyone to subscribe to our <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/biomod">Twitter</a> feed, where we constantly post links relevant research articles in the field. Keeping up to date on novel work in the field can provide a good starting point for brainstorming about project ideas for this summer.
